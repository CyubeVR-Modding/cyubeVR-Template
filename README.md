# cyubeVR-Template

Project generated by Archengius' [UE4 Template Generator](https://github.com/Archengius/UE4GameProjectGenerator). Reflected C++ classes generated by CheatingMuppet & Archengius' [UE4SS UHT Generator](https://github.com/UE4SS/UE4SS). If you want to use these tools to generate a cyubeVR project yourself, contact me (Buckminsterfullerene#6666) on Discord for information on how to fix all of the build errors *of which there are plenty*.

## Usage
To use, click use this as a template, [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop) or fork the repository and follow these steps:
* Copy all of your files from your old cyubeVR projects (if you have any) to the Content folder.
* Double click on cyubeVR.uproject to open the project!

If you want to generate a .sln file (or regenerate if one already exists), from inside Unreal Engine, navigate to File -> Create Visual Studio Project e.g. File -> Create Visual Studio Solution. It will then create a new solution file in the same directory as your project.

**If you have any code changes that you have made to the template source, please make an issue on this repository so that I can add it to the template when I generate the next version.**
